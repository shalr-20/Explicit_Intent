# Explicit Intent 

This project demonstrates how to use explicit intents to pass data between two activities in an Android application. The app has two activities:

1. **MainActivity**: Displays five `TextView` elements. Clicking on any of them will send the corresponding text to the second activity.
2. **SecondActivity**: Displays the text passed from the `MainActivity`.

---

## Features
- Uses **explicit intents** to navigate between activities.
- Passes data (the `TextView` text) from `MainActivity` to `SecondActivity`.
- Implements a single `OnClickListener` for handling multiple `TextView` clicks, ensuring clean and efficient code.
